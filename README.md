# pseudo-colouring-of-black-and-white-images-using-CNN
This Python-based project uses a pre-trained Caffe deep neural network and OpenCV to automatically add color to black and white images. Designed for both photography enthusiasts and machine learning hobbyists, the project simplifies the complex task of image colorization into an easy-to-use pipeline.
